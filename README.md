🛡️ Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project demonstrates a machine learning approach to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using real-world anonymized data. Leveraging techniques such as feature scaling, data balancing, and gradient boosting models, the project aims to identify fraudulent behavior with high accuracy and precision.
